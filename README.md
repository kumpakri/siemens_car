# Siemens Embedded Academy - Autonomous car

## Synopsis

Team project for Siemens Embedded Academy course. The goal of the project is to create autonomous toy car, which is able to navigate around objects and communicate with the toy car of other team.

## Implementation

STM32F4 Discovery Kit is used in this project to controll the toy car. Software is build on stm32f4xx library. More about implementation can be found in the [final report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wqcfwkqzfydh "final report")

## Installation

For using the code it is necessary to install [System Workbench for STM](http://www.openstm32.org/HomePage "Install System Workbench for STM") first. The project is then compilated and programmed on STM32F4 Discovery board.
